"# Interactive_Story_Generator" 
I got the inspiration for this project from Give Yourself Goosebumps by R. L. Stine. 
Basically the idea for this project is to have an interactive story where the user makes choices along the way and the direction of the story is based on those choices. There is a main ending for each story which is the most positive one along other endings.

Future Additions
In the future I plan to enable the use to select or generate the stories based on genres, likes. 
The user should be able to create characters, select the setting and the likely ending. 
I also want to be able to generate pictures or videos for each scenario based on the prompts and choices.
