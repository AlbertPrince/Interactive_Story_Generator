Setting Scene: "City of Shadows"

The once vibrant city now lay shrouded in an eerie silence, broken only by distant moans and the occasional sound of footsteps dragging along the desolate streets. The air is thick with tension, and the sky is a muted gray, as if the very atmosphere mourns the loss of humanity.

In the midst of chaos, you find yourself barricaded in a small apartment with your two sisters and little brother. Supplies are scarce, and every move you make could mean the difference between survival and becoming one of the undead.
